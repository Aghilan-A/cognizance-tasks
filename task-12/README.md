<h1>BANDIT</h1>

<p>Thank You for a such an interesting and engaging task like this one. I learned a lot from this task as my interest is cyber security. I have listed what I have learnt through each level<p>

0. <p>Zero level introduced me to ssh. </p>
1. <p>In the first level, basic commands like ls to list a directory files, cat to open files and exiting the ssh was introduced</p>
2. <p> Level two was confusing as it introduced me to dashed files. Dashed files operate as if they are an input output type of file.</p>
3. <p>Third level was also confusing as there were no files when listed. I got introduced to cd command and man(manual) command to read about every command.</p>
4. <p> The fourth level I got introduced to file command which tells the file type whether it is human- readable or not.</p>
5. <p>As the levels progressed I could feel the difficulty raising which made me search unneccessary things needed for the level. I was confused between du command and the file attribute of size.</p>
6. <p> This was even more challenging. It required me to run two commands in a single input which was new since every command before was just a single command. This level introduced groups, user attributes</p>
7. <p>Level 7, completely shattered me. The website introduced a command called grep. When reading abput the function of the command I thought the level was easy but then an error threw "memory exhausted". </p>
8. <p>From this level a different set of commands were introduced. Using sort command and a bit of manual search does the trick for this level</p>
9. <p> Uniq command deleted repetitive lines in the file to reveal the password.
10. <p> This introduced the base64 encoded data which was decoded by the base64 command.

<h4>Backstory:</h4>
<p>I was surfing,reading about starting in cybersecurity, and one of the suggestions was to look into this website(OverTheWire). Before I saw the tasks I did Bandit upto level 5 (with some tutorial help on level 3 and 5). I was really excited when this task was put up. I don't know whether I could submit other tasks.
But I am really satisfied with this task and I know I had done my best to learn from it. Thank you so much for including it.</p>

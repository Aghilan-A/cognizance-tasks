<h1>Why should we choose you?</h1>
I am hard working and a passionate reader, I will take time to completely analyse the problem to give an optimal solution . I have enhanced many skills and discovered some of new skills working upon the given tasks and I wish to be grateful and still enhance more of these skills to teach many more. I have noticed that I am more productive in a team which makes me an able team player. I wish to pursue cybersecurity and would love to share the knowledge.

<h1>What is your plan for the next 6 months?</h1>

* I plan to finish the additional tasks and the tasks that I have left in the next two weeks.
* I am currently doing some rooms in Tryhackme and wish to expand on that.
* I plan on exploring various platforms like HackTheBox, OverTheWire etc.,
* I also plan to do a course in Cybersecurity (starting with networking) in reputed websites like NPTEL, Udemy etc.,
* I plan to atttend hackathons and competitive programming competitions to gain sufficient industrial knowledge.
<p>At the end of this 6 months, my objective is to write simple hacking scripts(lack of better term) and not being a script kiddie.</p>

<h5>Note:</h5>
<p>I am currently vaguely stating my plans because I lack adequate knowledge in the domain and need to study more to actually proceed and set a definite course of action.</p>

<h1>How would you contribute back to the club?</h1>

I would love to mentor or teach my juniors,giving them tasks and working alongside with them. As I said I enjoy teaching and giving an idea. But from what I have noticed, this club emphasises more on individual realization rather than someone teaching them. Fortunateky, I think I can help with this idea, asking the right questions to a student will trigger his mindset. I believe that I am still under training and knowledge acuiring stage.So to achieve what I have said before, I should learn more and develop my skills.
